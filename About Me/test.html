    <h1>About Me: Tevin Stanley</h1>
    <img src="grinche la tevin.jpg" alt="picture of me">
    <p>I am a junior pursuing a degree in<em> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering">Computer Engineering</a></em>.
       I plan on having my focus be on security or embedded systems, but I am still exploring my options.
       During my free time I watch TV shows, listen to music, and play <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/">League</a> on certain occasions.
       I have been working on research to build a device to monitor beehives on a raspberry pi and mapping parking data on google maps.
       Donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
