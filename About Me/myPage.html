        <p>I am a junior pursuing a degree in<em> <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering">
        Computer Engineering</a></em>.
        I plan on having my focus be on security or embedded systems,
        but I am still exploring my options.
        During my free time I watch TV shows, listen to music, and play
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/">
        League</a> on certain occasions.
        I have been working on research to build a device to monitor beehives
        on a raspberry pi and mapping parking data on google maps.
        Donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

    <h2>How I found out about STARS</h2>
        <p> I remember one day I was at home checking my email, when I saw
            this email about UW with description saying something along the
            lines of <span style="color:yellow;text-decoration:underline">
            "get into <b style="color:red">YOUR</b> major with this!!!"</span>
            and I was immidietely intrigued (Yes, even though it looked just
            like a scam). I then printed out some paper work and wrote the
            essays and applied, what did I have to lose? Then I got another
            email asking me to come in and interview. I was scared out of my
            mind. After an hour of questions from Sonya about my drive in
            Engineering, I finally got an email congratulating me on getting
            into the program and that's that.
